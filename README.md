### How To Register a New User
1. Open Insomnia and create a new HTTP Request
2. Change the GET method to POST and enter the URL to the user endpoint: `https://travelit.fly.dev/users/`
3. Set the Body type to JSON and enter the following 

    To create a new super user (i.e. admin privileges):
   `{
		"is_superuser": true,
		"username": "<enter username>",
		"password": "<enter password>",
        "email": "<enter email>"
	}`

    OR

    To create a normal user:
    `{
		"is_superuser": false,
		"username": "<enter username>",
		"password": "<enter password>",
        "email": "<enter email>"
	}`

4. Click 'Send' to make the request. If successful, you should receive a response with status code 201 Created, and the JSON data containing the registered user's information.

### Create a User Token
A token is required to authorize a user to use other methods, such as POST, DELETE and UPDATE

6. Create a new HTTP Request and set the method to POST. This time enter the API-Token-Auth endpoint: 'https://travelit.fly.dev/api-token-auth/'
7. Set the Body type to JSON and enter the following:
    `{
		"username": "<your username>",
		"password": "<your password>"
	}`
8. Click 'Send'. If successful, you should receive a response with status code 200 OK and a token will be created.

### Use Token for Authorization
You can now enter this token in new HTTP Requests that you create that requires authorization. 

9. Once you have created a HTTP request, go to the Auth tab and select Bearer Token
10. Under Token, paste the token you have created for your user.
11. In Prefix, type in Token. Lastly, ensure Enabled is ticked. 
12. You can now return to the Body/JSON tab and send your request. Your request should be successful as your user authorization is now set.
